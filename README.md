# The Pinkie Framework

## What is Pinkie
Pinkie is a small machine learning library. Written just to write it.
It has two classifiers yet - 1-Nearest Neighbour & Multilayer Perceptron.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) - Classifier
"A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network.
An MLP consists of, at least, three layers of nodes:
an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer." ~ Wikipedia, 27. Oct. 2018.


### 1-Nearest Neighbour (1NN) Classifier
"The most intuitive nearest neighbour type classifier is the one nearest neighbour classifier
that assigns a point x to the class of its closest neighbour in the feature space [...]." ~ Wikipedia, 27. Oct. 2018.


## Why use Pinkie
Why not? - It's new. It's not the best. It's not from Google. - But why wouldn't you.
You can use your own activation functions or use the build in ones,
you can implement new classifiers, you can tune the build in ones.
And we can build a well working machine learning library on our own.
Let's make this project a great library for everyone.

To install Pinkie:
´´´
